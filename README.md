# (Updated 02/26/2020)
Major Updates Include:
- Improved $tu parse for greater range of $tu information
- Added new claim method.
# AutoWaifuClaimer
Auto claims from Discord Mudae bot. Adapted from my previous (now obsolete) AutoWaifuClaimer project, which used a Discord bot to listen for roll events and reacted using the pyinput module and the official Discord client. The previous implementation came with the major limitation of requiring Discord to be the main focused window, preventing the user from doing any other tasks at the same time. This new implementation solves that problem and is overall significantly more reliable and consistent.

# Features Coming Soon
Some requested and soon to be added features:
- [ ] Kakera React Filtering (React on specific kakera). 
- [ ] Improved $tu parse (Parse any a greater variety of $tu commands then the **vanilla** one).
- [ ] Greater control parameter control while running (Change how the bot interacts without restarting the container).
- [ ] Improved command timers (Bot will frequently send $tu on it's own to re-calibrate it's timers).
- [ ] Better claim logic -- Claiming (the bot can claim any waifu rolled |in the past 30+ seconds| as opposed to the absolute most recent).
- [ ] Better claim logic -- Filtering (If there is no desirable claim before the interval reset, bot claims most kakera roll)
- [ ] Claim confirmation (The bot will confirm if the claim was a success or failure). 
- [ ] React confirmation (The bot will confirm if the react was a success or failure).
- [ ] Bot will support toggle snipe settings (if toggle snipe is set, bot will wait the correct time for other rolls and instant for yours).
- [ ] Bot will support slash commands. 
- [ ] Web based dashboard for intuitive control of the bot.
- [ ] Bot will support preventing other people from claiming (Not a very nice thing to do but...)


## Features
- Automatically rolling at set intervals and (optionally) only if a claim is available
- Automatically claiming `$daily` and `$dk`
- Automatically sending `$im`
- Automatically claiming waifus that are listed in `data/lovelist.txt`, only if claim is available
- Automatically claiming kakera loot when available
- DM the main user on:
  - Attempts to claim
  - Attempts to react to kakera
  - Keys rolled
  - Alerts for liked characters
- Log all rolled characters
- Can run in the background 24/7
- Cross-platform support (?)

## Limitations and bugs
- Some unexpected behaviour

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop | https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop


## How it works
There are essentially three different processes running at the same time in this program. The first one opens browser Discord a headless Firefox window and attempts to login with provided credentials. The second one activates a Discord bot that will be listening for rolls and other activity. The last process controls the timers for rolling, claiming, kakera loots, and daily commands. Upon startup, the browser program will send a `$tu` command, which will be parsed by the bot. This will determine the time to next claim, roll, and daily. User commands are sent through Selenium keyboard actions to simulate a real user typing into the message box. Emoji reactions are interacted by executing Javascript on the site to click a specified reaction. As the program runs, the bot will continuously listen for rolls and parse them with regex (credit to [Znunu/EzMudae](https://github.com/Znunu/EzMudae) for the regex strings). If the roll is unclaimed and matches a name from the likelist, it automatically attempts a claim if one is available. Similarly, if a roll is already claimed, it automatically attempts a kakera loot if one is available. Lastly, if the roll is already claimed by the main user (specified in `config.py`), the bot will DM the user of a new key.

## Using with Docker Steps

- Download & Install Docker Desktop (Windows is awful so it will likely restart then ask you to install a Linux Kernel)

- Update `example.env` file `waifu_list/lovelist.txt` and `waifu_list/lovelist.txt`.

- Change `example.env` name to `.env`

- Update `config/config.py` file. (Requires credentials, **DO NOT** Version Control with credentials loaded)

- In the terminal, build the docker image for the python folder (Dockerfile Included): `docker build --tag waifu-claimer-v3 .`

- In terminal, start firefox container: `docker run -d --name firefox -e SE_NODE_OVERRIDE_MAX_SESSIONS=true -e SE_NODE_MAX_SESSIONS=3 -e SE_NODE_SESSION_TIMEOUT=86400 -p 4446:4444 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-firefox`

- In the terminal, run the build you created with: `docker run --name waifu-claimer waifu-claimer-v3`

If anything is not working, triple check you updated all the files above correctly, including adding every parameter to `example.env` 

If you alter any of the files after getting to the step with docker build you will have to run the `docker build --tag waifu-claimer-v3 .` again. (It's much faster)

Sometimes the bot fails to parse $tu, if it does fail just try to run it again.

Using the Docker UI to manually reset containers is ok, sometimes connections get stuck. 

Try your best to troubleshoot before submitting an issue :).
